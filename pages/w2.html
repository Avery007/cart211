<h1 id="title">Fight for Technological Sovereignty</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>The past</h2>
<p>According to this article, in the early 1970s, some Canadian experts were seeking for “technological sovereignty" that they wanted Canada to have an independent Internet system rathen than being tied with the American network that was built by the Defense Deparment.  <br><br>
  This desire reflects the perspectives of liberalism during 1970s, when people were worried about "American capitalism would eat Canada’s lunch" via Internet control.
  And perharps this vision also has something to do with <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/1970s/watergate">The Watergate Scandal</a>, which exposed the corruption of the Nixon administrationmade and some people lost trust on the American gorvenment. So they were concerned about the US government or corporations would spy on the residents and sell their personal data for a profit. As reported in an ealier CBC shows <a href=" https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/internet-fighting-the-futureSo"> Fighting the future</a>
Unfortunately, the conception of a Canadian-owned network was soon abandoned. But why this attempt failed? I think one possibility is that the force backing the network indurstry is stronge enough so that its dominance would not be shaken by the science council.
<br><br>
<h2> Today</h2>
Looking at the internet applications today, we can find that most of the widely-used apps and serves:Facebook, Google, microsoft, twitter..are provided by companies in US. The article reminds us of several scandals in recent years which reveal the abuse of personal data among these corporations:
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/snowden-leaks-timeline-2016-9">Edward Snowden’s leaks </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kjzvk/facebook-cambridge-analytica-not-a-data-breach">The case of Cambridge Analytica. </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne3bv7/equifax-breach-social-security-numbers-researcher-warning">Equifax Was Warned</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links">NSA taps into Google and Yahoo data hubs infuriate tech giants</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvnx85/has-net-neutrality-been-repealed"> Net Neutrality Is Officially Repealed</a></li>
</ul>
Maybe,what are revealed by news is just be the tip of an iceberg. We might be still blind about how our personal data are misused in wrong hands and in what way does it affact our life. How shoud we protect privacy becomes a serious chanllenge of modern Internet.
<br><br>
<h2>An addition</h2>
<br><br>

<br>
 Nowadays most people already get used to facebook, google and some even addicted to it. It is a challenge to make the mass accept a new social network system even it could be better.
Also, can we really gurantee the safty of individual data by just having a Candian network? In my opinion, the root behind the shadow side of Internet is human desire for power and money, similar to political corruption, and we should take it into consideration while trying to building a network with true freedom and security.

<h2>From Counterculture to Cyberculture:<br>The rise of a digital earth--The Rise of A New Brave World</h2>

<div id="quote"><i><b>“ What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that our fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.” <br>————Neil Postman </b><i>

This article suggests that modern Cyberculture rises from the Counterculture. The network technology is supposed to empower people because it enables the public to gain more knowledge.These technologies also provide more flexible ways for people to express their ideas. As a quote from the article:" <i>interactive computing technology was to pursue the New Communalist dream of social change</i>"
<br><br>
However, in modern times, Cycberculture has become a tool to promote and shape mainstream culture while the network is flooded with fake news and biased perspectives. While it allows more effective share of resources, the Internet can also be used for undesirable manipulation of online users' percepctions. Today, people tend to view the world via Internet. However, Does what we recieve online really reflect the reality,or just a virtual reality generated by network builders?
So I am questioning whether the shift from Counterculture to Cyberculture is successful.
