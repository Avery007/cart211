<p> <h2>The History</h2><br>
  According to <a href="http://cyberhouse.arted.psu.edu/visualculture/history_net_art.pdf">the reading</a>,
  When the internet first showed up, people didnt expect much from its function other than a communication tool. Yet the term "net art" accidentially came to the mind of Slovenian artist Vuk Cosic in the 1995. Then the idea of online art and communication started to go viral.
  During the 1990s, Internet helped the artists extend their potential as they could share challenging ideas without being marginalized by the community.
  <br>Note:<a href="https://rhizome.org/">rhizome</a> is one of the earliest websites dedicated to new media art.


<br><br><br><br>
  <h2>Cyberfeminism</h2>
<br><p>
  In 1997, the net.art exploded and several playful works were created. At the same time net.art allowed some female artists to display their advanced skills. When the Net.art platform mingled with the feminism during 1990s,
  it gave birth to the term "Cyberfeminist", who considered the Internet as a tool of feminist liberation.<br><br>
  <a href="https://vnsmatrix.net/the-artistsVNS"> VNS Matrix </a> is one of the first websites exhibiting the conception of cyberfeminism.<br>
 Based on this reference: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4x37gb/we-are-the-future-cunt-cyberfeminism-in-the-90s"> The History of cyberfeminism </a>
 Personally, I feel the idea of Cyberfeminism is more about transhumanism rather than feminism, or in other words, it is like feminism is leaded to the direction of roboticization ranther than focusing on feminine power itself.
   <br>The name VNS Matrix reminds me of the movie<i> The Matrix</i>. And the label New Brave Girls on their poster could be linked to the New Brave World.

  <h2>The New World of Net Art</h2>
<p>
  As the technology evolves, network enables people to deliver information in varies way: videos, images, medias..all of them are integrated into the network.
  As a quote from <a href="http://www.artnews.com/2013/06/12/the-new-world-of-net-art/"><u>This article</u></a>" We are looking at something that is becoming more hybrid. Pieces often have different manifestations: an application, a net-based piece, an installation.‚Äù
  Now the network seems to become "alive" as if it has own culture--a culture somewhat represents our society.<br><br>

  However,I think it is important to point out that the internet art doesnt really reflect the reality. While the virtual feature of internet gives arts many flexible abilities,
  it could also lead people to get lost in a computer-generated World.<br><br>
 <b>A video shows the illusion offered by internet:</b>

<br><br><br><br>

  <h2>The art of advertizement: commercial challenges for Net art</h2>
  <p>
During the class discussion, there was a topic of the issue of advertisements, and I do feel this is a problem that needs to be noted.<br>
As we are living in an age when the ads infiltrate deeply into our daily life, the network art is also not an exception. With the profit motive, things are hard to keep the original shape. With the Net art as an aid, the visions could be futher twisted and filled with exageration or even deception.<br><br>
