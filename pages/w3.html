<h2>History of Net Art</h2>
<p>
  The Internet art first emerged in the early 1990s. As the technology evolves, network enables people to deliver information in varies way, and the internet becomes not just a platform to share resurces, but the way how people organize their materials becomes a kind of art---today we have videos, images, medias, and all of them are integrated into the internet.
  The network seems to become "alive" as if it has own culture--a culture somewhat reprsents our society.<br><br>

  However,I think it is important to point out that the internet art doesnt really reflect our real culture because the network is easier to be manipulated.<br><br>

  Technologies make fake news flood into the network when it is so easy to modify images and videos.<br><br>

  The network art is also influenced largely by commercial avtivities.While our life is surrounded by advertisements, they tend to be exaggerated and unreal.<br><br>
  So perharps one noticeable feature of the net art is that people are stuck into a kind of virtual reality. We have get used to view the world through internet while often forgetting that what we find on internet may not be real.
