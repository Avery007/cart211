 <br><br>A quote:“Computers are catching hell from growing multitudes who
see them uniformly as the tools of the regulation and
suffocation of all things warm, moist, and human. The
charges, of course, are not totally unfounded, but in their
most sweeping form they are ineffective and therefore
actually an acquiescence to the dehumanization which they
decry. We clearly need a much more discerning evaluation in
order to clarify the ethics of various roles of machines in
human affairs.” <br><br>

I really like this paragraph,and it reminds me of the a presentation given by the UK prime minister recetnly, in which he expressed the same concern:
<br>【Digital authoritarianism is not, alas, the stuff of dystopian fantasy but of an emerging reality.】

<br>
While people have got used to the internet , and take the network's development for granted, maybe we should ask, do we really understand the computer, and how it exactly impacts our life and what kind of future it leads to?<br>
I know this may be considered as just a "conspiracy theory" by many people so that they wont take it seriously, but when we get rid of the official definition of "conspiracy theory", this is still an intereseting question worth pondering<br><br>
<br>Another quote from the article:<br>
"As the technology grows, human intelligence reducea"
 :It matters because we live in media, as fish live in water.
 (Many people are prisoners of the media, many are
 manipulators, and many want to use them to communicate
 artistic visions.)<br>
 But today, at this moment, we can and must design the
 media, design the molecules of our new water, and I believe
 the details of this design matter very deeply. They will be
 with us for a very long time, perhaps as long as man has left;
 perhaps if they are as good as they can be, man may even buy
 more time—or the open-ended future most suppose
 remains
