 <br><br><b>"catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think." ---Sherry Turkle</b><br><br>


<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Second-Self-Computers-Human-Spirit/dp/0262701111"> The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit</a>
<br>I find this book quite interesting sicne it discusses the relation between computer and human thoughts, that computer is not just a tool, but also it could
be an extend of our self to explore the world outside.<br><

Personally, I do beleive video games play an important role in our culture, and probably mostlt in a covert and subtle way that influences our subconsicness while we might not realize. What kind of influence to teenagers who play bloody video games as he is growing up?
Video games, as products from programming, can also be a tool to deliver the creator's messages, and it depends on how he wants to influence the users.<br>
So perharps, the power of video games largely depends on the creator's intention.

"If there is a danger here, it is not the danger of mindless play but of infatuation with the challenge of simulated worlds." <br>
As the technologies enable us to simulate our reality by computer, it also rises a question: what is the meaning of reality and how should we know if we ourselve have lost in the reality?
